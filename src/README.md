ctrulib
=======

CTR User Library
library for writing user mode arm11 code for the 3DS (CTR)

the goal with this is to create a very straightforward interface with the 3DS's OS.
it is not meant to provide higher level functions; to put things in perspective, the purpose of ctrulib would be to sit between the OS and a possible port of SDL rather than replace it.
